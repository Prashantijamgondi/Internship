### Custom Encryption-Decryption System

#### Description: Develop a program that encrypts and decrypts messages using custom encryption algorithms like substitution ciphers or matrix transformations.
- Challenges:
-- Create a robust algorithm for encryption and decryption.
-- Handle edge cases (e.g., special characters, spaces).
-- Optionally, implement multi-layer encryption.
- Skills: Algorithm design, string manipulation, and logical reasoning.
